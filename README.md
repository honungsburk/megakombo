# MegaKombo

Do you need to write your own parser? No, you don't. But if you do, you might as well use this one.

The particular goals of this library are:

- Make writing parsers as simple and fun as possible.
- Produce excellent error messages.
- Go pretty fast.
- Works with CommonJS and ESM. Browser or node.
- Strictly typed.
- Work on any type of input, not just strings.
- Streams for low memory footprint.
- No dependencies.

## Status

This library does not yet work. I recommend you check out my other library
[kombo](https://github.com/honungsburk/kombo) in the mean time.

## Installation

```bash
npm install @honungsburk/megakombo
```

## FAQ

### Why did you name this library _MegaKombo_?

My previous parser combinator library was called _Kombo_. This version is based on Haskell's [MegaParsec library](https://hackage.haskell.org/package/megaparsec-9.4.1).
